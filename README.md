# Predict Home Prices with Python and Linear Regression

*Scope of the Project*


The project aims to predict home prices using Python and linear regression. The primary objective is to build a predictive model that accurately estimates the price of homes based on various features. This involves collecting relevant data, preprocessing it, developing the linear regression model, and evaluating its performance. 

Key tasks include:

- Building and training a linear regression model to predict home prices.
- Evaluating the model’s performance and making necessary improvements.


*Software Used / Process / Methodology*


Software Used:

- Python

  
Libraries Used:

- pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
- numpy: For numerical operations.
- scikit-learn: For machine learning, specifically for building and evaluating the linear regression model.
- matplotlib: For data visualization.


Process and Methodology:

1. Data Collection:
- Gather a dataset containing home prices and load the dataset into a pandas DataFrame for analysis.

You can refer the orginal data here [(see excel)](https://github.com/razeeniqbal/python-predict-home-price/blob/main/home_dataset.csv). 

2. Data Preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
  - Create scatter plots and correlation matrices to identify relationships between features and the target variable (home prices).
- Feature Engineering:
  - Create new features or transform existing ones to better capture the relationships in the data.

3. Train-Test Split:
- Split the dataset into training and testing sets using the train_test_split function from scikit-learn.

4.Model Building and Training:
- Reshape the Data:
  - Prepare the data for the linear regression model by reshaping it using NumPy.
- Create and Train the Model:
  - Use LinearRegression from scikit-learn to create and train the model.
 
5. Predicting:
- Use the trained model to make predictions on the test set.

6. Model Evaluation:
- Visualization:
  - Create scatter plots of actual vs. predicted prices to visually assess the model’s performance.
